curl -X POST https://api.mollie.com/v2/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx" \

    "webhookUrl": "https://abcd1234.ngrok-free.app/webhook"
  }'
üîÑ Replace:
Authorization with your Mollie test API key

webhookUrl with your ngrok forwarding URL

üïµÔ∏è Inspect Webhook Traffic in Real Time
While ngrok is running, open:

cpp
Copy
Edit
http://127.0.0.1:4040
Here you can:

View all incoming webhook calls

Inspect full headers and body

Replay requests to debug issues

‚ö†Ô∏è Keep the ngrok Terminal Open!
Don‚Äôt close the terminal running ngrok http 3000.
This tunnel stays active only while that terminal is open. If you close it, Mollie can‚Äôt reach your local server.
